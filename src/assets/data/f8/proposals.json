The first sentence at Cardano.org is \u201cmaking the world work better for all\u201d and you can see this line in practically every video of Mr. Charles Hoskinson as well as many of the Cardano ecosystem activities.\n\nFollowing fund 6 we have conducted the research matching Catalyst proposals with SDGs and the results were very promising. This research showed that 27.5% of the funded proposals directly connect to impact the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs) and 68.5% indirectly connect to impact the SDGs. This is not a surprise as blockchain technology has the potential to have an impact on financial inclusion, governance, education, and other areas which comply with SDGs objectives.\n\nImpact-driven businesses (or the transformation of the business to have a greater societal impact) are a major business practice today. It has become a norm for large corporations, multinationals, and many small and medium-sized enterprises to have \u2018Social and environmental\u2019 focused departments, with such focus growing in importance for many stakeholders.\n\nMany corporate financial reports show this growing trend. An example is Nestle\u2019s 2020 annual financial report (the summary already includes some key relevant information), which highlights that Nestle\u2019s internal stakeholders see climate and decarbonization, innovative business models, digital and technology having a major impact on Nestle\u2019s success: https://www.nestle.com/sites/default/files/2021-03/2020-annual-review-en.pdf\n\nThis is a huge opportunity for Cardano to continue to be the leader in philosophy, technology, and initiatives that support the growing number of government initiatives, investors sentiment, and company projects aiming to \u201cmake this world better for all\u201d.\n\nCollaboration and partnerships are key to achieving the SDGs by 2030. It is the avenue by which we co-produce impactful solutions to wicked problems. Creating a space for these collaborations to take place, and designing a new framework to receive diligent leads, will help the global society work towards the successful implementation of the sustainable development agenda which is so critical to our continued thriving on this planet.\n\nTo that end, this proposal is being co-submitted by many of the existing community impact networks of Catalyst and Cardano,", "how_does_success_look_like_": "Larger amounts of Impact-investment in Cardano, companies building impact projects on Cardano, and mobilization of impact networks.", "importance": "Cardano is one of the greenest and impact-conscious blockchains.

They help to prevent duplicate challenge settings, remove challenges created by self interest, reduce the need for deep knowledge of the ecosystem from challenge proposal teams and also removes an easy entry point for malicious actors.\n\nThe full documentation for Catalyst Funding Categories can be found here: https://catalyst-swarm.gitbook.io/catalyst-funding-categories\n\n7 funding categories have been documented to cover all forms of ideas and proposals. All proposals can be found here - https://linktr.ee/cardanopace\n\nThe budget weighting for the 7 categories are to be confirmed after more community feedback.\n\n\u2014---------\n\n**Overview**\n\nNurturing Ideas is focused on the following important areas:\n\n*   New and existing ideas that can benefit from a smaller budget to nurture their initial exploration and growth efforts.\n*   Support of new teams joining the ecosystem looking for some initial capital to start off their project.\n\n**Why this category is important**\n\nThe ecosystem needs to have a way to easily introduce and nurture new and existing ideas that could provide impact to the ecosystem.\n\nHaving a category focussed on nurturing ideas can help to ensure that there is always exploration of new ideas, processes and approaches that could benefit the ecosystem.\n\nNurturing ideas & teams is a category that applies a cap to the amount of funding a proposal can request. This provides a less competitive environment for teams to find initial funding to nurture their growth and evolution.\n\nThis category can be seen as an on ramp for new ideas and teams for trying things out something and showing the community what they are capable of achieving.\n\nThe more ideas and exploration the community can nurture the faster the ecosystem can learn from and develop better solutions. The more new teams that can be formed the better the diversity and combined efforts that can be made as a community.\n\n**Types of proposals to include**\n\nAll proposal ideas are welcomed! Proposals must be related to the Cardano ecosystem whether that's a new idea, community initiative, marketing, development, support or any other type of proposal. To get some ideas you can refer to the other Catalyst funding categories!\n\n**Potential success metrics for proposal types**\n\nProposers should clearly identify what problem they are trying to solve, how they aim to solve that problem and share the types of outcomes the community should expect after the proposal is executed.\n\n**Proposal maximum budget**\n\nThe maximum proposal budget that can be requested is $40,000.\n\n**Considerations for proposers**\n\n*   **Existing initiatives and projects** - Proposers are encouraged to share in their proposal if there are similar proposals looking to achieve what they are requesting funding for. Share any information on collaborations with the community so voters are able to see your involvement in the community.\n*   **Open source plan** - There is no requirement that proposals that are producing software or digital assets need to be open source.

Diverse talent with its multitude of viewpoints leads to better innovation. Creating a more inclusive community will lead to a diversity of ideas and thoughts as well as a better sense of belonging. An innovation platform cannot afford to be homogeneous. If we want inclusive culture and a richer perspective, we have to listen to those who are different from the majority.</p><p><br></p><p>To an outsider, Catalyst is a blur. To a newcomer, it can be confusing. To those who stay, it's still confusing. How might we make Catalyst a safe and welcoming place for all kinds of people?</p><p><br></p><p>In the world of business, there\u2019s a saying \u2018Great employee experience leads to great customer experience\u2019. More than just financial rewards, people long for a sense of mastery, autonomy and purpose (see e.g. Daniel Pink: \"<a href=\"https://www.danpink.com/books/drive/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" data-embeddable=\"false\">Drive</a>\").</p><p><br></p><p>\"People who see the world differently and have diverse ideas and perspectives often bring creativity and innovation to an organization. But because of their outsider status, they may struggle to have their ideas recognized by colleagues as legitimate.\" (Harvard Business Review: \"<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2020/01/the-new-analytics-of-culture\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" data-embeddable=\"false\">The New Analytics of Culture</a>\")</p><p><br></p><p>Great culture is good for successful recruitment and retention of diverse talent. If people don\u2019t feel included, trusted and heard, they will either leave or remain lurkers forever. Culture needs to be built into the core of the organization and it needs to be nurtured over time via initiatives that encourage constructive sharing of ideas.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>There are many lenses, or paradigms, through which one can view diversity:</strong></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Resistance:</strong> Demand for diversity, coming from outside of the monocultural core group, is viewed as a threat to the perceived unity or a \u2018non-issue\u2019, something that is not important enough to even discuss. People feel safer working with similar colleagues so any attempts to increase diversity are stifled.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Non-discrimination:</strong> Also referred to as \u2018Color-Blindness\u2019 or meritocracy, this paradigm focuses on equal employment opportunities but without acknowledging potential differences due to different backgrounds. The thinking goes: \u201cPeople should be treated equally no matter where they are from; cultural background does not count and does not need to be specifically dealt with.\u201d Thinking \u2018we are all the same\u2019 aims to assimilate and hide diversity; important differences are not valued.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Fairness:</strong> In this paradigm, diversity is seen as a matter of equal opportunity and fair treatment. An organization addresses the need for specific support for minority groups, reducing social inequalities. While the concern for fairness is genuine, this is good for the organization\u2019s image and helps recruitment, while guaranteeing compliance with legal and social requirements. People operating from this standpoint may have good intentions but fall short in truly utilizing diversity for the organization\u2019s and its members' full benefit. Preserving harmony may stifle creative dissent.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Access and legitimacy:</strong> In this paradigm, differences are celebrated but only because they make business sense. The thinking goes that for the organization to be relevant, it needs to portray the same diversity as the global society it operates in. The danger of this approach is that monoculture remains the norm and \u201dthe diverse\u201d are kept on the sidelines. People may feel exploited if they find out that they are there just to make the organization look diverse.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>Learning and growth:</strong> This final paradigm also promotes equal opportunity, acknowledges differences and values them but it doesn\u2019t assimilate everyone into one mold or form silos and pockets of diversity. Instead, it connects people with diverse traits, backgrounds, knowledge and skills. Listening is encouraged and differences are internalized so that the organization can learn and grow because of them.</p><p><br></p><p>The benefits of adopting the learning and growth paradigm are clear:</p><p><br></p><ul><li>It brings new ideas and different knowledge for everyone\u2019s use.</li><li>It helps us to develop new skills and approaches to the work we do.</li><li>It helps us become more innovative as individuals, as teams and as a whole organization.</li></ul><p><br></p><p>When culture of inclusion becomes a collective strength, it helps align strategies with people\u2019s diverse capabilities. However, it takes time and needs to be enabled through a consciously built culture that encourages trust and belonging.</p><p><br></p><p>In this kind of culture, everyone feels at ease, no matter how heated the daily discussions get. In a truly effective innovation platform, it is not only okay to voice out differing opinions; it is expected.</p><p><br></p><p><strong>An ideal Catalyst Culture:</strong></p><p><br></p><ul><li>Is fun, relaxed and welcoming.</li><li>Communicates that diversity of background, opinion and insight are essential.</li><li>Creates an expectation of high standards of performance from everyone.</li><li>Stimulates personal development and emotional intelligence.</li><li>Promotes peer mentoring and learning from one another.</li><li>Encourages openness, trust, asking, listening and a sense of belonging.</li><li>Makes people feel heard, respected and valued.</li><li>Breathes life into a well-articulated and widely understood mission.</li><li>Supports and maintains an egalitarian and non-bureaucratic structure.</li><li>Allows a degree of creative friction for innovation to flourish.</li></ul><p><br></p><p><strong>Examples of proposals you could submit to this challenge:</strong></p><ul><li>Educational events to explore the related concepts and research</li><li>Discussion fora to help us understand each other and to work better together</li><li>Use of software to make meeting culture more inclusive (e.g. <a href=\"https://otter.ai/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" data-embeddable=\"false\">Otter</a> &amp; <a href=\"https://www.equalicert.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\" data-embeddable=\"false\">Equalicert</a>)</li><li>Analysis tools to understand how culture influences Catalyst members' thoughts and behaviour.</li><li>Social media content creation to help raise awareness</li><li>Tools that help in recruitment and onboarding of top talent</li><li>Incentives for bringing different types of people together in teams</li><li>Surveys, interviews and documentation of \"the Catalyst pulse\"</li><li>Systems and processes that strengthen inclusiveness in Catalyst</li><li>Partnerships with external expert organizations</li><li>Initiatives to clarify our shared mission, vision, values and goals</li><li>Competence development tools and frameworks</li><li>Mentoring, coaching and peer support structures and solutions</li><li>Wellbeing and community listening related initiatives</li><li>Celebrations, rites, rituals and other cultural artefacts to strengthen the culture</li><li>Leadership development initiatives</li><li>Equal participation and engagement initiatives</li></ul><p><br></p><p>It is up to all of us to propose initiatives that help strengthen the most important asset Cardano has: the community.

The best way to fight Co2 emissions is by reducing energy-consumption. But this is not enough we need to make Cardano itself Climate Positive and surely, if we can make our contributions for the World to be Climate Positive and to make it a regenerative, better place, we should incentivize that with at least a small % of our Potential.\n\nWhat began as a challenge, has turned into a community: Cardano4Climate\n\nWhile holding weekly meetups for 3 month now we have engaged with many different proposers and Projects. Last funding round as a community, we have identified \\[1\\]more than 12 proposals that were closely related to this challenge and we invited many more into the \\[2\\]sustainability event that we hold continuously now.\n\nWhen talking about the fundamentals of Climate Change itself we would like to encourage you to read up on the papers and the official reports. We specifically refer to the \\[3\\]IPCC reports (we also linked a shorter and easier to read press-release in the links section):\n\n\"GENEVA, Aug 9 \u2013 Scientists are observing changes in the Earth's climate in every region and across the whole climate system, according to the latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Report, released today. Many of the changes observed in the climate are unprecedented in thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of years, and some of the changes already set in motion\u2014such as continued sea level rise\u2014are irreversible over hundreds to thousands of years.\"\n\n\"The report projects that in the coming decades climate changes will increase in all regions. For 1.5\u00b0C of global warming, there will be increasing heat waves, longer warm seasons and shorter cold seasons. At 2\u00b0C of global warming, heat extremes would more often reach critical tolerance thresholds for agriculture and health, the report shows.\"\n\n\"Stabilizing the climate will require strong, rapid, and sustained reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, and reaching net zero CO2 emissions. Limiting other greenhouse gases and air pollutants, especially methane, could have benefits both for health and the climate\"\n\n**How will this challenge provide a springboard for Cardano adoption?**\n\nThe green-movement is bigger than ever and companies like tesla are immensely popular and successful not because they create cars that accelerate faster but because their electric and therefore environmental friendly cars are clearly one very important piece of the puzzle when it comes to preventing climate change. If we had to take a *wild guess* as to one of what the other pieces of the puzzle could be, we would probably look into better governance systems. Something Catalyst is trying to solve and Cardano as a blockchain will touch heavily on, if not solve, in the not so far future.\n\n**How will this challenge advance Cardano's mission?**\n\nIf we can't build Systems that are better than our traditional Systems, what are we doing here? We could go back to central banks and governing classes that can be controlled and lobbied by the biggest corporations in the world. How to better proof that Cardano is a worthwhile endeavor to the young, the governments, the people than by showing our commitment and contribution to the environment.\n\n**Guiding questions**\n\nWhat will have the greatest impact on climate change in the short and long term?\n\nWhat real-world regenerative solutions already exist that would benefit from applications developed on the Cardano blockchain now, and in the near future?\n\nHow can we incentivize individuals, local communities, councils and municipal authorities, businesses and governments to prioritize taking action to reduce our overall carbon footprint?\n\nWhat are the most useful and scalable applications to put Cardano at the forefront of real, actionable solutions which reduce the greenhouse gases we will pass on to future generations?\n\nHow can we minimize Cardanos CO2 emissions further or even become Climate positive?\n\n**Proposal success metrics:**\n\nHow big is the impact on Cardanos self-sustainability?\n\nHow big is the impact on Co2 emissions?\n\nHow big is the impact on regenerating our planet?\n\nHow big is the awareness that will be created?\n\nIs your proposal financially sustainable after funding?\n\n**Budget rationale**\n\nObviously this is not a Climate Fund, but having a small percentage being used for exploration on how Cardano can help solve this wicket problem is really the minimum we can do given the urgency of the issue now and the long time it took for it to finally be recognized by the mainstream.\n\n**Links**\n\nJoin our Community!\n\nhttps://linktr.ee/Cardano4Climate\n\nPress release on IPCC-report:\n\nhttps://www.ipcc.ch/2021/08/09/ar6-wg1-20210809-pr/\n\n**References**\n\n\\[1\\] https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1w89O_6R-sqd9WmCTttdaUtwAenckJlZt1nJT2LmatQY/edit#gid=0\n\n\\[2\\] https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/Cardano-Catalyst-Community-Network/events/jqqjqsyccqbtb\n\n\\[3\\] https://www.ipcc.ch/report/ar6/wg1", "how_does_success_look_like_": "Climate Change impact has been significantly reduced by successfully nurturing and completing Catalyst Projects now and in the future.", "importance": "Legacy systems have failed us on climate change!

In particular, the shortage of development funds and engineers is serious, and students have few opportunities to get these resources. However, Catalysts are easier to raise money than VCs(Venture Capital) and Business Contests, and also can connect globally with engineers in this community. However, the number of proposals to Catalysts is increasing rapidly, and the community does not easily notice small-scale proposals from students. In addition, it is difficult to set a clear Roadmap while resources are scarce and to get a high evaluation from CA(Community Advisor).\n\nTherefore, to make it easier for the community to recognize new ideas from students, we will establish a new Category exclusively for students. In addition, instead of the roadmap being ambiguous, we set a budget limit of $ 5,000. By doing so, many students can experience funding from Catalyst. In continued participation in Catalyst, funding experience, even on a small scale, is evaluated by the community. Therefore, it is important to set a budget limit.\n\nThe Category Goal is to encourage engineers to scout students who are evaluated by the community and create a new team to join the next Fund with a clear Roadmap. This is a benefit for both students and engineers to raise a large salary for engineers through Catalyst rather than from VCs or Banks.\n\n**Team & Relevant experience**\n\n\u30fbIssa Ichikawa (Twitter: https://twitter.com/Cardano_ISSA)\n\n21-year-old/Junior at Waseda University in Japan/Student entrepreneur/Catalyst Fund6 raiser/Catalyst CA/Catalyst Fund6 Challenge Team Member (Connecting Japan Community)\n\n\u30fbYUTA\u00a0(Twitter: https://twitter.com/yuta_cryptox)\n\nCardano Ambassador/SPO/Japan representative of Eastern Town Hall Meeting/Catalyst Fund2,6,7 raiser/Catalyst CA/Catalyst Fund6 Challenge Team Member (Connecting Japan Community)", "how_does_success_look_like_": "By setting up a student category and increasing the exposure of their ideas, they can expect easier funding and scouted from engineers.", "importance": "Most student entrepreneurs are suffering from resource shortages, especially in funding and engineer recruitment."}, {"id": 399693, "category": 26455, "comments_count": 1, "title": "DAOs <3 Cardano", "url": "https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/399693-48088", "description": "<p>How can we make Cardano the go-to choice for building DAOs?

By providing people involved in distributed autonomous organisations with the comprehensive suite of planning and decision-making tools needed, cohesive democratic processes can be run through a single sign on, incorporating the best open source distributed apps currently available into one packaged solution.\n\nPanacea is an informal group of professionals brought together through common interests spanning emergent technology, new potentials for democracy, and new forms of decentralised organisational structure.\n\nOur driving force is the recognition that current socioeconomic, political and financial institutions adhere to forms of governance that are no longer fit for purpose and do not represent the best interests of the vast majority of people. Instead, they are used to wield power, exert control and concentrate wealth in the vested interest of the privileged few.\n\nWe have developed an approach that could stimulate the grass roots adoption of distributed governance tools and processes, which when integrated effectively with decentralised finance could eventually replace the established order with one designed to encourage cooperation and collaboration instead of competition and domination. (See below for schematic details).\n\nThe main reason for this brief is that there is currently no integrated toolkit that allows democratic organisations to function via a single sign on. While the enterprise and small business markets are fulfilled by many vendors with scalable solutions, the not-for-profit sector and activist communities have to make do with stitching together various open source tools and paid software to try to achieve their organisational goals.\n\nNone of these tools make it easy for members of these organisations to collaborate and make good decisions, or provide visibility and accountability over their finances to members and stakeholders.\n\nThis Challenge proposal aims to establish the ground work to build this needed platform coordination and integration.\n\nIn F8 we intend to submit stand-alone proposals to lay the ground work for the basic architecture and gain a firmer grasp on the user cases needed to build out this cooperative platform management system.

This makes it the nation with the 19th most cryptocurrency users \\[1\\]. This however does not capture the entire picture as the growth of this number has been 10 fold in the past year \\[2\\]. This massive growth can most directly be attributed to the rising prices of cryptocurrencies and to the speedy devaluation of the Turkish Lira (around ~40% against the US Dollar in 2021).\n\nDevaluation of the currency has gotten exceedingly worse and is set to continue in the near future. The negative effects are felt throughout the country as wages tumble on a USD basis. The minimum wage is around $220 as of the time of this proposal (nearly half the working population earn min. wage), meaning any funds put to work in Turkey can get lots of involvement from the local population.\n\nDespite this growth, Cardano adoption is very low. Although there is an ADA trading community of around 2853 people just in the telegram group, there is currently no broader Cardano community. The majority of the investors in the trading group were drawn to ADA by the performance of the cryptocurrency. As a result, trader emotions like fear and greed dominate the conversation within cryptocurrency communities, resulting in misinformation about the broader Cardano community. As such, a Turkish Cardano community is sorely needed to raise awareness of the vision of Cardano beyond the token price.\n\nWe the proposers of this challenge are trying to do so and bring more qualified Turkish people into the Cardano community. However, we are just a group of three within Project Catalyst with a broader network of around 20 that are involved in cryptocurrencies in Turkey. If the real value of Cardano can be demonstrated in Turkey, this number will dramatically increase. This is especially true given that the majority of young people are interested in participating in international projects. However, they face language obstacles and lack some of the relevant competencies. Therefore more initiatives are needed to realize the potential of Turkey and to aid the global adoption of Cardano.\n\nGiven these points, what could Turkey offer the Cardano community back in return? Turkey has great potential in its qualified IT and cybersecurity personnel built thanks in part to a solid financial services sector. It also has a large pool of young, active and forward looking individuals, looking to contribute to their communities. This challenge aims to bring this potential to the Cardano ecosystem.\n\nGuiding questions\n\nHow can we involve general ADA holders in project Catalyst in Turkey?\n\nHow can we increase the number of SPOs from Turkey?\n\nHow can we increase more meaningful participation from Turkey?\n\nHow can we encourage new members to utilize the tools and services available for onboarding?\n\nHow can we localize the existing materials?\n\nChallange Team\n\nCem Karaca\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ckaraca\n\n\u00d6zg\u00fcr Ya\u015far Akyar\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/ozguryasarakyar\n\n\u00c7a\u011fkan Acarbay\n\nhttps://www.linkedin.com/in/%C3%A7a%C4%9Fkan-acarbay-b2210b136\n\nReferences\n\n\\[1\\] https://triple-a.io/crypto-ownership-turkey/.\n\n\\[2\\] https://www.paribu.com/blog/en/news/paribu-has-published-the-results-of-the-most-comprehensive-cryptocurrency-survey-cryptocurrency-use-in-turkey-has-increased-by-10-times", "how_does_success_look_like_": "Motivated community of developers, SPOs, stakers, voters, challenge teams collaborating for the growth of Cardano from Turkey in 2023.", "importance": "The decentralisation and resilience of Cardano are based on the inclusion of different locations including those communities not involved."}, {"id": 398526, "category": 26455, "comments_count": 2, "title": "Great Impact, Great Funding", "url": "https://cardano.ideascale.com/a/dtd/398526-48088", "description": "How can we implement big impact projects that improve Cardano\u2019s scalability, interoperability, decentralization or security?", "tags": [], "author": "vladimirp", "requested_funds": "1200000", "challenge_brief": "This challenge is designed to provide a large budget for larger projects that can research and then deliver finalized products in a mid-term time horizon (up to 12 months) while also providing regular updates to the community along the way.\n\nSome specific guidelines are introduced, for the submission of a proposal in this challenge:\n\nThe budget for a single proposal should not be below $200,000\n\nProposals should be for complete projects, with published solutions and/or deployable or usable by end users on delivery\n\nThe delivery should take place within 12 months from start of funding\n\nAs part of the proposal submission, the team must explain the expected beneficial impact of the project on the Cardano system in detail so that the proposal\u2019s expected impact can be fully assessed\n\nThe proposing team must provide one or more ways of keeping the Cardano community (In addition to the Challenge Team) updated on progress during project implementation at least on a monthly basis with a focus on transparency\n\nThe proposing team must provide detailed references for the team and the individual members working on the proposal - thus proving relevant experience with the subject matter and that they are capable of delivering the solution\n\n\n\n**Guiding questions for proposers**\n\n*   What are the key problems facing Cardano in the coming period in terms of scalability?\n*   What are the key problems facing Cardano in the coming period in terms of interoperability?\n*   What are the key problems facing Cardano in the coming period in terms of decentralization?\n*   What are the key problems facing Cardano in the coming period in terms of security?\n*   What are the best infrastructure solutions used on other ecosystems that could serve as inspiration for Cardano?\n\nWhat are the bottlenecks that are already looming on the horizon that could stifle Cardano\u2019s growth and need to be resolved and why are they urgent?\n\nMore ambitious projects with greater impact should compete for larger funding under this challenge if they can prove their proposal will have a large impact and the team has competency in the topic.\n\nThis challenge invites proposers to apply for funding for projects that tackle core issues affecting Cardano\u2019s present and future, such as scalability, interoperability, decentralization.\n\nThe precise theme of the proposed project is free, but should comply with the challenge brief.", "how_does_success_look_like_": "Quality projects will increase performance and utility of Cardano over a longer horizon.

Social enterprises seek to maximize both impact and profits, and the profits are largely channeled back to serve the purpose of the organization. Design thinking, truly understanding the target group's needs and ability to scale the solutions after a few iterations of \"trial and error\" are crucial for any social enterprise.\n\n**In this challenge, proposals can be submitted by existing social enterprises seeking to expand their business, new social enterprises seeking start-up funding, and social enterprises looking to innovate their business model through Cardano adoption.

Achieving this will create a thriving community, an easier to use development ecosystem and nurture a growing list of products and integrations.\n\nThe better that Catalyst is able to effectively help with governing and distributing funds the faster the ecosystem can create the innovations and adoption needed for Cardano to thrive. The better open source tools are made available for governance and identity within the ecosystem the faster interesting and novel solutions can be deployed.\n\n**Types of proposals to include**\n\n*   **Governance tools, libraries & SDKs** - Tools that help with governance participation and decision making that can be used by Catalyst but also could be used by other teams building in the ecosystem.
