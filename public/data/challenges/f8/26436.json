            "content": "The success of Bitcoin spawned numerous off-shoot experiments and the arrival of Ethereum increased tribalism. As the number of altcoins grew, unhealthy \"maximalism\" emerged. The future is multi-chain, however, and the cryptoeconomy thrives when interoperability and cross-chain collaboration are cherished and encouraged.,There are multiple next generation blockchains with cadres of zealous supporters, highly skilled developers and innovative technologies that Cardano and Project Catalyst can learn from. And, vice versa, we can help other networks thrive by offering the good practices developed in Catalyst. IOG has recently formed the UTXO alliance and started collaboration with numerous partners like COTI and SingularityNET. It's a good start but more is needed to address the lack of communication, coordination and collaboration between blockchain communities. Missing awareness of each other's doings forces us to duplicate our efforts. When we are separate we are not able to learn from each other's achievements or failures.,Cardano has a strong, open and inclusive community, let's make this a real super power and let's be the first ones to forge strong bonds. Let's create an enriching, open and safe environment, where people from different communities can find common ground and share knowledge, resources, skills, ideas and visions with one another. Let's go out there, break the silos and build bridges and presence between us."

Our proposed challenge is intentionally left open ended and it welcomes a multitude of different solutions. Worthwhile ideas submitted in this challenge should help grow and improve the Cardano and Catalyst community in the near term (next 6-9 months).,This challenge is therefore aligned with the Fund8 strategic goals:,The budget of $400,000 USD is a moderate 2,5% of the total treasury allocation for Fund8. It should be sufficient to kickstart interoperability and cross-chain collaboration initiatives but might not be enough for any large scale infrastructure projects. Therefore, \n\nIt helps prepare people to make contributions to the Cardano and Catalyst ecosystem.\n\tIt helps turn Cardano into an open source project recognized also beyond our community.\n\tIt accelerates the growth and evolution of our developer & app ecosystem by inviting contributions from the rest of the blockchain space."
